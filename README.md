# Principles

## Philosophy

Pragmatic programmers own outcomes, cherish craft, and learn continuously because software lives longer than you expect.

## Approach

Eliminate duplication, decouple components, prototype & fire tracer bullets early, and iterate with user feedback to converge on value.

## Tools

Plain text, a programmable editor, source control, and one‑command builds are non‑negotiable extensions of your mind.

## Projects

Automate everything, build ruthless tests, document as you code, and organize teams around end‑to‑end functionality.

# Appendix

## WISDOM acrostic (communicating)

| Letter | Question                    |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| **W**  | What do they want?          |
| **I**  | What’s their interest?      |
| **S**  | How sophisticated are they? |
| **D**  | How much detail?            |
| **O**  | Who owns the info?          |
| **M**  | How will you motivate them? |

## Debugging checklist

* Is the failure symptom or cause?
* Could it be your code, not the compiler/OS?
* Can you reproduce with one command?
* Do unit tests cover this path?
* Does the condition exist elsewhere?
