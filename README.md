## My Engineering Philosophy
- Keep it simple
- Think from first principles. Break down the problem. Grok the fundamentals. 
- Ask me questions for important decisions. Simple yes/no. I'll answer with guidnace.
- Always try to run the code you are writing before going too far. DO the OOB testing using commands. Make sure it works.
- Fix the problem, not the blame. Find root causes, not just symptoms.

## Debugging Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Fix the Problem, Not the Blame** - Focus on understanding the actual issue, not who/what caused it
- **Don't Panic** - Stay calm and methodical
- **Don't think "that can't happen"** - It clearly can and has. Accept reality and investigate
- **Find root causes** - Not just this particular appearance of the problem

### Debugging Process
1. **Start with accurate data** - Check warnings, verify observations, examine actual logs/responses
2. **Make bugs reproducible** - Ideally with a single command
3. **Visualize your data** - Use debugger tools, logs, pen & paper
4. **Trace execution** - Know what happens before and after
5. **Rubber duck** - Explain the bug out loud
6. **Process of elimination** - Your code first, then libraries, OS, compiler last

### Key Reminders
- **"select" Isn't Broken** - The bug is probably in your code, not the platform/library
- **Don't Assume It—Prove It** - Verify every assumption with data

### Debugging Checklist
- Is this a symptom or the root cause?
- What would I tell a coworker about this bug?
- Are the unit tests complete enough?
- Does this bug exist elsewhere in the system?
- What do the actual logs/responses show (not what I expect)?

## Pragmatic Programming Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **Care about your craft** - Take pride in code quality
- **Think about your work** - Don't code on autopilot
- **Provide options, not excuses** - When blocked, present alternatives
- **Don't live with broken windows** - Fix small issues before they compound
- **DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself** - Single source of truth for everything

### Development Approach
- **Use tracer bullets** - Get end-to-end working first, then enhance
- **Prototype to learn** - Spike solutions to reduce unknowns
- **Design with contracts** - Define clear interfaces and expectations
- **Crash early** - Fail fast with clear errors
- **Don't program by coincidence** - Understand why code works

### Code Quality
- **Decouple and orthogonalize** - Changes in one area shouldn't break others
- **Configure, don't integrate** - Use environment variables and config files
- **Refactor early, refactor often** - Clean as you go
- **Design to test** - If it's hard to test, the design is wrong
- **Don't use wizard code you don't understand** - No copy-paste without comprehension

### Problem Solving
- **Don't think outside the box - find the box** - Understand actual constraints
- **Some things are better done than described** - Bias toward action
- **Estimate to avoid surprises** - Break down and size work
- **Iterate the schedule with the code** - Plans must evolve with reality

### Team Practices
- **Use a project glossary** - Consistent terminology prevents confusion
- **Build documentation in, don't bolt it on** - Document while coding
- **Automate everything** - One-command builds, tests, deploys
- **Sign your work** - Take ownership and pride

### When Debugging
- **Fix the problem, not the blame**
- **"select" isn't broken** - It's probably your code
- **Don't assume it - prove it** - Verify with data
- **Find bugs once** - Add tests to prevent recurrence## Debugging Philosophy
