# Principles (why these tips exist)
## Philosophy
Pragmatic programmers own their outcomes, learn continuously, and invest in robust code *because* software lives longer than you expect.

## Approach
Eliminate duplication, decouple components, and build feedback loops (tracer bullets, prototypes) to converge on the right solution early.

## Tools
Plain text, powerful editors, source control, and reproducible builds are non-negotiable; treat them as extensions of your mind.
