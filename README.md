  Pragmatic Programming Principles

  Core Philosophy

  - Care about your craft - Take pride in code quality
  - Think about your work - Don't code on autopilot
  - Provide options, not excuses - When blocked, present alternatives
  - Don't live with broken windows - Fix small issues before they compound
  - DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - Single source of truth for everything

  Development Approach

  - Use tracer bullets - Get end-to-end working first, then enhance
  - Prototype to learn - Spike solutions to reduce unknowns
  - Design with contracts - Define clear interfaces and expectations
  - Crash early - Fail fast with clear errors
  - Don't program by coincidence - Understand why code works

  Code Quality

  - Decouple and orthogonalize - Changes in one area shouldn't break others
  - Configure, don't integrate - Use environment variables and config files
  - Refactor early, refactor often - Clean as you go
  - Design to test - If it's hard to test, the design is wrong
  - Don't use wizard code you don't understand - No copy-paste without comprehension

  Problem Solving

  - Don't think outside the box - find the box - Understand actual constraints
  - Some things are better done than described - Bias toward action
  - Estimate to avoid surprises - Break down and size work
  - Iterate the schedule with the code - Plans must evolve with reality

  Team Practices

  - Use a project glossary - Consistent terminology prevents confusion
  - Build documentation in, don't bolt it on - Document while coding
  - Automate everything - One-command builds, tests, deploys
  - Sign your work - Take ownership and pride

  When Debugging

  - Fix the problem, not the blame
  - "select" isn't broken - It's probably your code
  - Don't assume it - prove it - Verify with data
  - Find bugs once - Add tests to prevent recurrence
